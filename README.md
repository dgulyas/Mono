## These are a bunch of Mono experiments.

Game 1: Copied code showing shape drawing.

Game 2: Draws a grid of squares.

Game 3: Artistic grid of squares.

Game 4: Benchmark how many dots can be drawn before lag.

Game 5: Draws a moving pixel with trail using a texture to retail the trail.

Game 6: Computes the intersection of 2 moving line segments.

Game 7: Bouncing a particle off a line with circle intersections. Inaccurate.

Game 8: Bouncing a particle off a line with inverted line slope. Much more accurate.

Game 9: Bounce multiple points off multiple lines. Too Slow.

Game 10: Multi-thread particle movement, and simplify reflection logic. Still too slow.

Game 11: Give each particle it's own texture. Still too slow.

Game 12: Use a queue of textures to that the GPU never renderd what the CPU is using. Still too slow.

Game 13: Don't erase screen and just draw the newest particle locations. Very fast. Woot.

Game 14: Rainbow circle radiating outwards, reflecting off walls.

Game 15: Minor changes from 14. Holding spacebar pauses it.
